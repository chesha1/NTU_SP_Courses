# NTU_SP_Courses
Nanyang Technological University School of EEE Signal Processing Program  
This repository will give some detailed information of the SP program courses, and the content is not always correct.  
The language used in this repository will be English and Chinese, and the understanding of course content is often written in Chinese.  
I may introcude many textbooks and they may not always be needed. You do not have to read all of them, but I still recommend you to at least just scan them briefly. Same thing will be taught and explained differently in different books. All the books mentioned in this repository can be found in zlibrary.
  
关于NTU EEE学院 信号处理项目课程的一些具体内容，不都对，关于课程内容的理解主要以中文书写  


## EE6204 System Analysis  
This course is actually about operations research, I do not like the names of NTU courses, why do we need to call operations research system analysis? This course will introduce linear programming, ? ????? chronologically.  
### Textbooks  
#### Introduction to Operations Research, 9th edition, Frederick S. Hillier  
This book has Chinese translated edition. This book is mostly recommended. It is a classic textbook in China, so you may be familiar with it.


## EE6401 Adavanced Digital Signal Processing
Classic Digital Signal Processing course. It has some connection with EE6204 in terms of DFT.
### Textbooks 
#### Digital Signal Processing: Pearson New International Edition, 4th edition, Proakis
This book is the only textbook used by the lecturer, and I would like to remind you that It has a solution manual.
#### Digital Signal Processing: Principles, Algorithms, and Applications, 4th edition, Proakis
This book actually has similar content with the former book, and more importantly it has Chinese translated edition and solution manual, so I recommend it more compared with the former one. As it is the textbook used by lecturer, I recommend it most.
#### Discrete-Time Signal Processing, 3rd edition, Alan V. Oppenheim
This book has same or more reputation than the former book, and it is also a great book. You can choose either of them to read. This book also has solution manual and Chinese translated version.



## EE6427 Video Signal Processing
This course is a little bit complicated as it does not follow any of the textbooks below. It synthesizes many short parts of the textbooks.
### Textbooks 
#### Digital Image Processing, 4th edition, Gonzalez
This book has Chinese translated edition. This book is mostly recommended. It is a classic textbook in China, so you may be familiar with it. This book includes many theortical things and formulas.

#### Fundamentals of Multimedia, 2rd edition, Ze-Nian Li
For the basic concept of multimedia, this book is great and deserves recommended. For the theory behind the basic concept, this book just gives a brief introduction. So I may not recommend this book.

#### Multimedia Signal Processing: Theory and Applications in Speech, Music and Communications, 1st edition, Saeed V. Vaseghi
It is the reference book of the course. The typesetting of the book is great and the book itself looks good, but in terms of content, I do not recommend it.

#### Image and video compression for multimedia engineering: fundamentals, algorithms, and standards 
This book is better than the former two books. In terms of encoding of JPEG, it gives the detailed introduciton.



## EE7401 Probability & Random Processes
This course is about propbability theory with measure thoery. Measure theory is another hard math thory, so I recommend
