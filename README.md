# NTU_SP_Courses
Nanyang Technological University School of EEE Signal Processing Program  

The Signal Processing Program at Nanyang Technological University's School of EEE is featured in this repository. Please note that the information provided may not always be accurate.  
This repository contains detailed information about the courses offered in the SP program, presented in both English and Chinese. Course content is primarily explained in Chinese.  
Various textbooks may be referenced in this repository, but not all of them are mandatory reading. However, I suggest scanning through them briefly, as they offer different explanations of the same concepts. All books mentioned in this repository are available on zlibrary.  
  
关于NTU EEE学院 信号处理项目课程的一些具体内容，不都对，关于课程内容的理解主要以中文书写  

该仓库中可能会引用各种教科书，但并非所有教科书都是必读的。但是，我还是建议简单浏览一下它们，因为它们对相同的概念提供了不同的解释。 提到的所有书籍都可以在 zlibrary 上找到。

**本仓库中的所有内容不保证正确，尤其是作业和考试的解答**


## EE6204 System Analysis  
This course will cover linear programming, non-linear programming, random process(especially Markov chain), queue model and decision analysis chronologically.  
The course content is relatively easy to grasp, so I will only suggest a few notes as learning materials and will not recommend many textbooks.    
There will be two open-book quizzes that are not particularly difficult, and the final exam will also be manageable. There is not much memorization required to prepare for the exam.  

本课程，按时间顺序，包括线性规划、非线性规划、随机过程（尤其是马尔可夫链）、队列模型和决策分析。  

课程内容比较容易，所以我不会推荐很多教材。  

课程会有两道不是特别难的开卷小测验，期末考试也不难。 准备期末考试也不需要背诵太多内容。  

**Textbooks**  
#### Introduction to Operations Research, 9th edition, Frederick S. Hillier  
This book has Chinese translated edition. This book is mostly recommended. It is a classic textbook in China, so you may be familiar with it.

## EE6222 Machine Vision
课程难度：中等

考核方式：1次quiz，2次作业，期末考试

期末考试：难度高，需要背诵的内容中等偏多。除了本门课过去的试卷，还可以参考一下EE7403的试卷



## EE6227 Genetic Algorithms and Machine Learning
看PPT就行了  

考核方式：有两次作业和一次 quiz，难度不大  

考试：注意下往年题型，有两种计算题是那种几乎年年考的。老师最后给的复习的 pdf 里列举的知识点，和考试需要写的内容重合度很高，注意一下。总体难度不高，背诵量中等   


## EE6401 Adavanced Digital Signal Processing
This course covers three important topics in digital signal processing: multi-rate signal processing, linear prediction, and optimal linear filter, as well as power spectrum estimation. Unlike other courses, where topics are scattered across various books, this course provides a concentrated and easy-to-read content. However, due to the relative unpopularity of this area of digital signal processing, there are limited teaching resources available online, which can make self-study challenging.  
This course is considered difficult and is not recommended for those without a background in digital signal processing. It is best suited for those who have completed an undergraduate degree in this field, although it is still possible to take the course without this background.  
The assessment method for this course includes homework, quizzes, and a final exam. The homework is considered to be more challenging than the exam, with a moderate amount of memorization required for both.  

主要内容：多速率数字信号处理、线性预测和最优线性滤波器和功率谱估计，就是教材上的三章内容，不像别的课一样，教学内容分散在各种书的各种地方，教学内容集中，比较方便看，但是因为这一块属于数字信号处理的冷门内容，网上的教学视频和其他教学材料又比较少，没有太多的材料可供自学  

这门课比较难，不推荐选，最好本科学过数字信号处理，但是没学过问题也不大  

考核方式：作业+测验+期末考试，作业很难，比考试还难，考试也很难。需要背诵的内容适中  

**Textbooks** 
#### Digital Signal Processing: Pearson New International Edition, 4th edition, Proakis
This book is the only textbook used by the lecturer, and I would like to remind you that It has a solution manual.
#### Digital Signal Processing: Principles, Algorithms, and Applications, 4th edition, Proakis
This book actually has similar content with the former book, and more importantly it has Chinese translated edition and solution manual, so I recommend it more compared with the former one. As it is the textbook used by lecturer, I recommend it most.
#### Discrete-Time Signal Processing, 3rd edition, Alan V. Oppenheim
This book has same or more reputation than the former book, and it is also a great book. You can choose either of them to read. This book also has solution manual and Chinese translated version.

## EE6402 Real-time DSP Processing and Applications
看PPT就行了  

考核方式：两次作业，难度简单。期末考试难度一般，需要的背诵量一般  

**Textbooks**
#### VLSI Digital Signal Processing Systems: Design and Implementation
在讲Part 4的时候，如果觉得不够，可以看一下这本书，虽然我觉得看PPT和课程视频完全够用了

## EE6403 Distributed Multimedia Systems
看PPT就行了，和EE6427有部分内容一样  

考核方式：一次作业，一次quiz。作业难度一般，quiz难度中等偏上，背诵量中等偏上。  

期末考试难度一般，背诵量中等偏上。  

## EE6427 Video Signal Processing
This course covers a wide range of complex topics, and as there is a change of teacher in 2022, there are no previous years' questions available for the exam.  
The assessment for the course comprises of homework, quizzes, and exams. The homework assignments are relatively simple, requiring only a written discussion of the plan without the need for code. The quizzes and exams are not considered to be very difficult, but students are required to have a deep understanding of the extensive and detailed PPT materials provided. Additionally, **a significant amount of recitation** is expected for students.  

课程内容多且杂，由于2022年换老师了，所以考试没什么往年题可以参考  

考核方式：作业+测验+考试。作业很简单，只需要文字论述方案，不需要写代码。测验和考试单纯难度不高，但是需要把很长很长很长的PPT都理解，背诵量大。

**Textbooks** 
#### Digital Image Processing, 4th edition, Gonzalez
This book has Chinese translated edition. This book is mostly recommended. It is a classic textbook in China, so you may be familiar with it. This book includes many theortical things and formulas.

#### Fundamentals of Multimedia, 2rd edition, Ze-Nian Li
For the basic concept of multimedia, this book is great and deserves recommended. For the theory behind the basic concept, this book just gives a brief introduction. So I may not recommend this book.

#### Multimedia Signal Processing: Theory and Applications in Speech, Music and Communications, 1st edition, Saeed V. Vaseghi
It is the reference book of the course. The typesetting of the book is great and the book itself looks good, but in terms of content, I do not recommend it.

#### Image and video compression for multimedia engineering: fundamentals, algorithms, and standards 
This book is better than the former two books. In terms of encoding of JPEG, it gives the detailed introduciton.



## EE7401 Probability & Random Processes
This course, along with EE6204 and EE6401, covers stochastic processes. While the topics overlap, each course has a different focus, and they complement each other well. The difficulty level of this course is not high.  
Assessment for this course involves two homework assignments and an exam, with both being of average difficulty. Probability theory can be studied solely through the PPT materials provided, as the content not covered in the PPT is not included in the exam. The exam format is generally consistent year after year, with minor variations such as testing on linear MMSE in one year instead of testing on ordinary MMSE in previous years.  

这门课和EE6204 EE6401都涉及随机过程，但是侧重点都不同，相互之间可以算有点配合，课本身的难度不高

考核方式：2次作业+考试，作业难度一般，考试难度一般

概率论部分看PPT就行了，不用看书，PPT上有的内容根本不考，每年题型都很固定，但是会有小变化，比如往年考普通MMSE，今年考Linear MMSE  

**Textbooks**
#### Probability, Random Variables and Stochastic Processes
老师用的教材，抽了几章中的部分内容出来讲，有中文版和习题解答
