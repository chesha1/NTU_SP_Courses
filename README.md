# NTU_SP_Courses
Nanyang Technological University School of EEE Signal Processing Program  
This repository will give some detailed information of the SP program courses, and the content is not always correct.  
The language used in this repository will be English and Chinses, and the understanding of course content is often written in Chinese.  
I may introcude many textbooks and they may not always be needed. You do not have to read all of them, but I still recommend you to at least just scan them briefly. Same thing will be taught and explained differently in different books.
  
关于NTU EEE学院 信号处理项目课程的一些具体内容，不都对，关于课程内容的理解主要以中文书写  
可能会介绍很多教科书，不需要全读一遍，但我还是建议至少简单看一下，同一个东西可能会在不同的书里有不同的表述  

## EE6204 System Analysis  
This course is actually about operations research, I do not like the names of NTU courses, why do we need to call operations research system analysis? This course will introduce linear programming, ? ????? chronologically.
