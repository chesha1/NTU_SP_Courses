# NTU_SP_Courses
Nanyang Technological University School of EEE Signal Processing Program  
This repository will give some detailed information of the SP program courses, and the content is not always correct.  
The language used in this repository will be English and Chinese, and the understanding of course content is often written in Chinese.  
I may introcude many textbooks and they may not always be needed. You do not have to read all of them, but I still recommend you to at least just scan them briefly. Same thing will be taught and explained differently in different books. All the books mentioned in this repository can be found in zlibrary.
  
关于NTU EEE学院 信号处理项目课程的一些具体内容，不都对，关于课程内容的理解主要以中文书写  
放假了不想费劲写英文了，剩下的更新全部用中文，开摆  


## EE6204 System Analysis  
This course will introduce linear programming, non-linear programming, random process(especially Markov chain), queue model and decision analysis chronologically.  
Content of this course is not hard to understand, so I will not recommend many textbooks and notes are good enough to learn.  
There will be two open-book quizzes and they are not hard. Final exam is also not hard. There are not much thing to recite to prepare for the exam.
### Textbooks  
#### Introduction to Operations Research, 9th edition, Frederick S. Hillier  
This book has Chinese translated edition. This book is mostly recommended. It is a classic textbook in China, so you may be familiar with it.


## EE6401 Adavanced Digital Signal Processing
主要内容：多速率数字信号处理、线性预测和最优线性滤波器和功率谱估计，就是教材上的三章内容，不像别的课一样，教学内容分散在各种书的各种地方，教学内容集中，比较方便看，但是因为这一块属于数字信号处理的冷门内容，网上的教学视频和其他教学材料又比较少，没有太多的材料可供自学  
这门课比较难，不推荐选，最好本科学过数字信号处理，但是没学过问题也不大  
考核方式：作业+测验+期末考试，作业很难，比考试还难，考试也很难。需要背诵的内容适中
### Textbooks 
#### Digital Signal Processing: Pearson New International Edition, 4th edition, Proakis
This book is the only textbook used by the lecturer, and I would like to remind you that It has a solution manual.
#### Digital Signal Processing: Principles, Algorithms, and Applications, 4th edition, Proakis
This book actually has similar content with the former book, and more importantly it has Chinese translated edition and solution manual, so I recommend it more compared with the former one. As it is the textbook used by lecturer, I recommend it most.
#### Discrete-Time Signal Processing, 3rd edition, Alan V. Oppenheim
This book has same or more reputation than the former book, and it is also a great book. You can choose either of them to read. This book also has solution manual and Chinese translated version.



## EE6427 Video Signal Processing
This course is a little bit complicated as it does not follow any of the textbooks below. It synthesizes many short parts of the textbooks.  
课程内容多且杂，由于2022年换老师了，所以考试没什么往年题可以参考  
考核方式：作业+测验+考试。作业很简单，只需要文字论述方案，不需要写代码。测验和考试单纯难度不高，但是需要把很长很长很长的PPT都理解，背诵量大。
### Textbooks 
#### Digital Image Processing, 4th edition, Gonzalez
This book has Chinese translated edition. This book is mostly recommended. It is a classic textbook in China, so you may be familiar with it. This book includes many theortical things and formulas.

#### Fundamentals of Multimedia, 2rd edition, Ze-Nian Li
For the basic concept of multimedia, this book is great and deserves recommended. For the theory behind the basic concept, this book just gives a brief introduction. So I may not recommend this book.

#### Multimedia Signal Processing: Theory and Applications in Speech, Music and Communications, 1st edition, Saeed V. Vaseghi
It is the reference book of the course. The typesetting of the book is great and the book itself looks good, but in terms of content, I do not recommend it.

#### Image and video compression for multimedia engineering: fundamentals, algorithms, and standards 
This book is better than the former two books. In terms of encoding of JPEG, it gives the detailed introduciton.



## EE7401 Probability & Random Processes
这门课和EE6204 EE6401都涉及随机过程，但是侧重点都不同，相互之间可以算有点配合，课本身的难度不高
考核方式：2次作业+考试，作业难度一般，考试难度一般
概率论部分看PPT就行了，不用看书，PPT上有的内容根本不考，每年题型都很固定，但是会有小变化，比如往年考普通MMSE，今年考Linear MMSE
### Textbooks
#### Probability, Random Variables and Stochastic Processes
老师用的教材，抽了几章中的部分内容出来讲，有中文版和习题解答
